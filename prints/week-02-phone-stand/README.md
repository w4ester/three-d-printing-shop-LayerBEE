- Phone for testing the fit

## Recommended Settings
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|

| Infill | 20% |
| Nozzle Temp | 200-210C |

## Design Challenge
Try making your own in Tinkercad! Your design should:
- Hold phone at 45-60 degree angle
- Have a lip to prevent sliding
- Be stable (won't tip over)
- Allow charging cable access (bonus!)

## Success Criteria
- Phone sits securely at viewing angle
- Stand is stable on desk
- No wobbling or tipping
- Clean print quality

## Share Your Print!
1. Take a photo of your stand with phone
2. Note your slicer settings
3. Fork this repo and add to `community-prints/`

## Troubleshooting
- **Phone doesn't fit?** Measure and adjust dimensions
- **Tips over?** Widen the base or add weight
- **Bad overhangs?** Add supports or redesign angle

Happy printing! - LayerBEE
