# Week 3: 3DBenchy Troubleshooting Print

The 3DBenchy is the ultimate diagnostic print - designed to test every aspect of your printer.

## What You'll Need
- PLA filament (any color)
- Your 3D printer leveled and ready
- Calipers for measuring (optional but recommended)

## Recommended Settings
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.2mm |
| Infill | 10-15% |
| Nozzle Temp | 200-210C |
| Bed Temp | 60C |
| Supports | NO |
| Speed | 50mm/s |

## What Benchy Tests

| Part | Tests | Good Sign |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Bottom | First layer adhesion | Flat, no warping |
| Hull | Curved surfaces | Smooth layers |
| Windows | Bridging | Clean rectangles |
| Roof | 45° overhangs | No drooping |
| Chimney | Stringing & detail | No strings, clean |
| Text | Fine detail | Readable letters |

## Success Criteria
- Hull length: 60mm (+/- 0.5mm)
- No stringing between chimney and cabin
- Porthole is circular, not oval
- Text on stern is readable
- No warping on bottom
- Smooth layer lines on hull

## Common Issues to Check
1. **Stringing from chimney** → Increase retraction
2. **Droopy roof** → More cooling, lower temp
3. **Warped bottom** → Better bed adhesion
4. **Rough hull** → Check belts, reduce speed
5. **Oval porthole** → Belt tension or steps/mm

## Share Your Print!
1. Take photos showing all angles
2. Measure dimensions with calipers
3. Note any issues you found and fixed
4. Fork this repo and add to `community-prints/`
