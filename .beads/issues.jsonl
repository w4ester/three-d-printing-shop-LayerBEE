Customer adds items to cart\n2. Customer enters name + contact (classroom/period or phone)\n3. Order submitted → shows Zelle/Venmo payment info\n4. Customer sends payment with order ID in memo\n5. Admin marks paid when payment received\n6. Admin marks delivered when item handed over\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Keep it simple: localStorage first, no backend needed initially\n- Could evolve to use a simple JSON file or Google Sheet for persistence\n- Zelle/Venmo don't have APIs - just display payment info with instructions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Customer can complete checkout without credit card\n- [ ] Order ID generated for tracking\n- [ ] Payment instructions clearly displayed\n- [ ] Admin can track order status\n- [ ] Works offline (localStorage)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"11763006+w4ester@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T11:51:49.848972-05:00","created_by":"Will F","updated_at":"2026-01-20T11:51:49.848972-05:00"}
